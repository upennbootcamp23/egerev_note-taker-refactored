## Installation

The following third-party apps were installed:
- Node.js
- Express.js 
- Path

## Usage

When the user opens up the main menu, a page pops up that says "Get Started". Once the user clicks on the button, he/she can add a note. After he/she created the note, the user can either delete the note or save the note. If the user saves the note, the note is saved to Local Storage.

## Credits

While I may have had some help from multiple sources (as listed below), I can assure you that the work provided is my own, original work.

1. My colleague, Leo, helped me out with the project. In fact, I should tell you that the website template was once his project - he was working on this way back in 2010. Now, 13 years later, he is giving this template to me. This is seen in my project.

2. This is a refactoring of the project created by "miniature-eureka". Thanks to whoever "miniature-eureka" is.

3. I had trouble deploying the app to Heroku. The app ALWAYS crashed. That is, until Tom Woods helped me out, along with Stack Overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54999746/heroku-app-crashed-status-503-which-issues-can-occur). Thanks to that, Heroku FINALLY activated!
